# traffic_signals_classification
I build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.
The dataset contains more than 50,000 images of different traffic signs. It is further classified into 43 different classes. The dataset is quite varying, some of the classes have many images while some classes have few images. The size of the dataset is around 900 MB unzipped. The dataset has a train folder which contains images inside each class and a test folder which we will use for testing our model.

I have successfully classified the traffic signs classifier with 92.20% accuracy and also visualized how our accuracy and loss changes with time, which is pretty good from a simple CNN model.


 we also build a graphical user interface for our traffic signs classifier with Tkinter. Tkinter is a GUI toolkit in the standard python library.
